Extensible, sortable & bulk action capable members listing + export to CSV tool for Paid Memberships Pro.

### Description

Extensible, sortable & bulk action capable members listing tool for Paid Memberships Pro. This plugin is a complete replacement for the "Members List" functionality in PMPro and supports most of the same filters and hooks. The key differences have to do with managing columns. Now you can also use the [standard WordPress filters](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/wp_list_table/) to columns you can add/remove/make sortable, additional bulk actions, etc.

### Installation

1. Upload the `e20r-members-list` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your site.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
